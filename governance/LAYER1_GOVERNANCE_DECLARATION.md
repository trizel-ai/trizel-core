## I. Document Purpose and Classification

### Purpose
This document serves as the **permanent, non-operational, declarative governance record** for Layer-1 within the TRIZEL ecosystem.

**This document:**
- Is governance-only, non-executable, non-operational
- Provides canonical terminology and memory references
- Establishes governance interpretation rules
- Locks epistemic memory for Layer-1
- Resolves all terminology ambiguities permanently

**This document does NOT:**
- Authorize operational activity
- Execute code or algorithms
- Contain functional logic
- Enable scientific publication
- Modify SYSTEM FREEZE status

### Classification
**Governance Declaration** — Declarative and archival in nature

---

## II. Terminology Resolution — Canonical and Binding

### A. Deprecated Terms — PERMANENT BAN

The following terms are **permanently banned** from all TRIZEL content:

#### 1. "STOE" and All Variants
**Status:** ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN  
**Action if found:** REMOVE COMPLETELY  
**No exceptions:** No reinterpretation, no preservation, no equivalent constructs allowed

#### 2. Equivalent Constructs
Any term, acronym, or reference that attempts to represent the same deprecated concept as "STOE" is **equally forbidden**.

**Forbidden patterns include but are not limited to:**
- Direct mention of "STOE"
- Acronym variations
- Theoretical lineage references to deprecated frameworks
- Historical preservation attempts
- Indirect references through description

### B. Canonical Replacement Terminology

**When referencing deprecated historical concepts:**

**REQUIRED TERM:**
```
"Historical non-operational reference"
```

**Usage:**
- Use ONLY when historically necessary
- Always non-interpretive
- Never implies endorsement
- Never implies functional capability
- Maintains governance neutrality

**Example Acceptable Usage:**
"This work addresses historical non-operational reference material through governance-compliant terminology."

**Example Forbidden Usage:**
"This work extends [deprecated term]" ❌
"Building on [deprecated concept]" ❌

## III. AUTO DZ ACT — Foundational Epistemic Memory Marker

### A. Registration Declaration

**AUTO DZ ACT** is hereby registered as a **Foundational Epistemic Memory Marker** within TRIZEL governance.

### B. Status and Classification

**Status:** MEMORY-ONLY  
**Classification:** Non-Functional, Non-Operational Epistemic Reference  
**Authority:** Layer-0 Governance (this document)

### C. Characteristics

**AUTO DZ ACT as Epistemic Memory:**

1. **Memory-Only Nature**
   - Exists as epistemic reference marker
   - Non-functional (does not execute)
   - Non-operational (does not process data)
   - Declarative archival marker only

2. **Cross-Layer Epistemic Link**
   - Linked to all TRIZEL layers as epistemic memory
   - Provides terminological continuity
   - Maintains governance-compliant identity
   - Does NOT authorize functional implementation

3. **Prohibited Reinterpretation**
   - Cannot be functionally overloaded
   - Cannot be reinterpreted as operational
   - Cannot be extended with variants
   - Cannot be versioned (no "AUTO DZ ACT v1", "AUTO DZ ACT system", etc.)

4. **Mandatory Canonical Reference**
   - Must be referenced exactly as: **AUTO DZ ACT**
   - Exact spacing required (not AUTO-DZ-ACT or AutoDzAct)
   - Exact capitalization required
   - No additional qualifiers permitted

### D. Canonical Form Enforcement

**ONLY ACCEPTABLE FORM:**
```
AUTO DZ ACT
```

**FORBIDDEN FORMS:**
```
AUTO DZ ACT system      ❌
AUTO DZ ACT v1          ❌
AUTO-DZ-ACT             ❌ (wrong hyphenation)
AutoDzAct               ❌ (wrong capitalization)
auto dz act             ❌ (wrong capitalization)
```

### E. Logo and Visual Context

Where applicable in logo contexts or visual representations:
- **AUTO DZ ACT** remains the canonical textual reference
- Visual representations must not contradict this epistemic memory status
- Any visual representation is subordinate to this governance declaration

### F. Relationship to Layer-1

**AUTO DZ ACT** serves as the canonical algorithm name referenced in Layer-1 (Research Documentation) epistemic analysis activities when authorized.

**Important Clarifications:**
- This registration does NOT authorize Layer-1 activity
- This registration does NOT lift SYSTEM FREEZE
- This registration does NOT enable functional execution
- This registration provides terminological governance ONLY

## IV. Governance Declaration Handling Rule

### A. Rule Statement

**Any comment issued by `trizel-admin` GitHub account containing PR Title, PR Description, Activation Language, or Classification Language constitutes a binding canonical governance reference, even if no specific action is explicitly requested.**

### B. Scope and Authority

**Authoritative Source:** trizel-admin GitHub account

**Binding Content:**
- PR titles assigned or specified
- PR descriptions provided or mandated
- Activation declarations
- Classification statements
- Governance interpretations
- Terminology resolutions

**Authority Level:** Canonical governance interpretation

### C. Enforcement

**Effect:**
- trizel-admin comments establish canonical governance state
- No additional approval required for governance interpretation
- Comments constitute formal governance record
- Must be preserved in governance ledger or referenced documentation

**Compliance:**
- All repository contributors must comply with trizel-admin declarations
- Conflicts resolved in favor of trizel-admin interpretation
- Appeals must go through formal governance review

**Documentation:**
- trizel-admin declarations should be referenced in relevant governance documents
- PR records containing trizel-admin comments are part of governance history
- Significant declarations should be incorporated into this ledger or related governance files

### D. Relationship to Existing Governance

**This rule complements existing governance:**
- Does not supersede TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md
- Does not override SYSTEM FREEZE
- Does not grant scientific authorization
- Provides governance interpretation authority within existing framework

---

## V. Layer-1 Governance Context

### A. Layer-1 Definition

**Layer-1** within TRIZEL: **Research Documentation and Epistemic Analysis**

**Characteristics:**
- Internal, non-published analysis
- Subject to SYSTEM FREEZE by default
- Requires explicit authorization for activity
- Produces non-publishable internal working documents only

### B. Governance Constraints

**Layer-1 operates under:**
1. **SYSTEM FREEZE** (active by default)
2. **Authorization requirement** (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001)
3. **Internal-only scope** (no publication, no public release)
4. **Non-interpretive stance** (governance provides structure, not scientific claims)

### C. Existing Layer-1 Documents

**Current Layer-1 governance documents:**
- `authorizations/internal/LAYER1_ACTIVATION_RECORD.md` — Terminology compliance record (superseded by this document)
- `authorizations/internal/LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md` — Template for operational protocols (remains valid as template structure)

**Relationship:**
- This declaration **supersedes** LAYER1_ACTIVATION_RECORD.md for canonical governance
- LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md remains valid as **template infrastructure only**
- Any conflicts resolved in favor of this declaration

## VI. Epistemic Memory Lock

### A. Memory Lock Declaration

The following governance interpretations and terminological resolutions are **permanently locked** as canonical epistemic memory for TRIZEL:

1. **"STOE" is permanently banned** — No reinterpretation, no preservation, no equivalents
2. **"Historical non-operational reference" is the canonical replacement** — For deprecated concept references
3. **AUTO DZ ACT is the canonical algorithm name** — Memory-only, non-functional, exact form required
4. **trizel-admin comments are binding governance** — Canonical interpretation authority
5. **This document is the single Layer-1 governance authority** — All prior ambiguities resolved

### B. Immutability

**These memory locks:**
- Cannot be reinterpreted without Layer-0 governance amendment
- Cannot be weakened or bypassed
- Cannot be forgotten or ignored
- Are binding on all future TRIZEL work

### C. Governance Amendment Process

**To modify these memory locks:**
1. Submit formal governance amendment proposal
2. Document reason for change with strong justification
3. Obtain Layer-0 governance approval
4. Update this document with version increment
5. Record amendment in TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md
6. Update all dependent governance documents

**Threshold:** High bar for amendment (requires demonstrated necessity and broad consensus)

---

## VII. Compliance and Enforcement

### A. Compliance Requirements

**All TRIZEL work must:**
- [ ] Respect this canonical governance declaration

- [ ] Contain ZERO instances of banned terms (STOE, variants, equivalents)
- [ ] Comply with trizel-admin governance interpretations
- [ ] Reference this document for Layer-1 governance authority

### B. Enforcement Mechanisms

**Automated:**
- Deprecated terms CI check (blocks PRs with banned terminology)
- Governance enforcement workflow
- Schema validation

**Manual:**
- Governance review of Layer-1 PRs
- trizel-admin oversight
- Compliance verification before merge

### C. Violation Handling

**If banned terminology found:**
1. Automated CI check fails
2. PR blocked from merge
3. Contributor notified
4. Terms must be removed completely (not replaced)
5. PR re-reviewed after correction

**If governance ambiguity arises:**
1. Consult this document as canonical authority
2. Escalate to trizel-admin if needed
3. Document resolution in governance ledger
4. Update this document if necessary
