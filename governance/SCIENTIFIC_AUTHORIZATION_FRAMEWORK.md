# SCIENTIFIC_AUTHORIZATION_FRAMEWORK.md

**Repository:** trizel-ai / trizel-core  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** [Date of merge]  
**Last Reviewed:** [Date of merge]  
**Governing Authority:** TRIZEL Governance (Layer-0)  
**Status:** DRAFT — FRAMEWORK ONLY (NO SCIENTIFIC AUTHORIZATION GRANTED)

## Governance Notice

This document defines a **Scientific Authorization Framework only**.

It **does NOT grant Scientific Authorization** and **does NOT lift or modify** the active
**SYSTEM FREEZE** declared by TRIZEL governance.

Until an explicit **Scientific Authorization Declaration** is issued via a separate,
isolated governance Pull Request, **all scientific execution, publication, and endorsement
remain prohibited**.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes a formal **Scientific Authorization Framework** governing how
scientific outputs *may* be reviewed, evaluated, and authorized **if and only if**
governance explicitly permits scientific activity in the future.

The framework is designed to ensure that any future authorization process adheres to
internationally recognized principles of:

- Scientific integrity
- Reproducibility
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Ethical responsibility

This framework is informed by widely accepted international norms, including:
- UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021)
- UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021)
- Established scientific validation and uncertainty-reporting practices
  (e.g. IPCC, WHO, ISO/IEC guidance where relevant)

This document defines **process and conditions**, not permission.

---

## 2. Scope

If activated in the future, this framework would apply to authorization decisions concerning:

- Final scientific models or model checkpoints
- Scientific results, figures, tables, or claims
- Derived datasets intended for publication or external release
- Interpretive or policy-relevant scientific conclusions

**Explicitly out of scope (always handled via standard non-scientific governance processes):**
- Code refactoring or maintenance
- Documentation updates
- Governance, policy, or compliance files
- Internal exploratory work not proposed for endorsement

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities (Conditional)

The following roles are defined **for a potential future authorization phase only**:

| Role                            | Responsibility                                        | Authority         |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Contributor                     | Prepares reproducible artifacts and documentation     | Proposes only     |
| Scientific Reviewer (min. 2)    | Independent verification and critique                 | Recommends        |
| Governance Authority (Layer-0)  | Final decision and audit record                       | Grants or denies  |
| External Advisor (optional)     | Independent advisory review                           | Non-binding       |

Reviewers must be independent and must not be direct contributors to the output under review.

---

## 4. Scientific Authorization Process (If Ever Activated)

No scientific authorization may occur unless governance explicitly activates this framework.
If activated, authorization would require **all** of the following stages:

### 4.1 Preparation
- Full reproducibility package (code, data access, environment, fixed seeds)
- Clear documentation of assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty
- Disclosure of ethical, legal, and societal considerations

### 4.2 Independent Scientific Review
- Minimum of two independent reviewers
- Written evaluation covering reproducibility, validity, limitations, and over-claim risk
- Explicit recommendation recorded in writing

### 4.3 Governance Verification
- Confirmation of compliance with governance policies
- Conflict-of-interest disclosure
- Confirmation that no SYSTEM FREEZE or higher-level prohibition applies

### 4.4 Authorization Decision
- Authorization requires:
  - Two positive reviewer recommendations, **and**
  - Explicit governance sign-off
- Decisions recorded as:
  - Authorized
  - Authorized (Conditional)
  - Not Authorized

Without explicit governance approval, **no scientific output is considered endorsed**.

---

## 5. Documentation & Traceability

If activated, all authorization decisions must be:
- Fully documented
- Auditable
- Stored within governance-controlled records
- Linked to reviewer assessments and decision rationale

Unauthorized outputs may not be presented as official, validated, or endorsed.

---

## 6. Validity, Revocation, and Re-evaluation

Any future authorization:
- Is time-bound
- May be revoked upon discovery of error, misconduct, or governance breach
- Must be re-evaluated if methods, data, or assumptions materially change

Governance retains full authority to revoke authorization at any time.

---

## 7. International Regulatory Awareness (Non-Binding)

This framework is designed to remain compatible with evolving international norms,
including but not limited to:

- UNESCO Open Science principles
- Domain-specific scientific validation practices
- Risk-based AI governance approaches (e.g. EU AI Act awareness for released AI systems)

This section is **informational only** and does not constitute legal advice or regulatory
certification.

---

## 8. Relationship to SYSTEM FREEZE

- This framework does **not** override or weaken the SYSTEM FREEZE.
- While SYSTEM FREEZE is active:
  - No scientific authorization may be granted
  - No publication, DOI, Zenodo deposition, or scientific endorsement is permitted
- A separate **Scientific Authorization Declaration** document is mandatory to lift
  restrictions, if governance ever decides to do so.

---

## 9. Change Control

This framework may only be modified through:
- Governance-approved Pull Requests
- Documentation-only changes
- Explicit versioning and review records

---

**End of Framework**
