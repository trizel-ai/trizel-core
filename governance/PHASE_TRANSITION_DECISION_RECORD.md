# Phase Transition Decision Record

**Title:** Phase Transition Decision Record  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** ACTIVE — CANONICAL  
**Authority:** Layer-0 (Governance)  
**Effective_Date:** 2026-01-21

---

## I. Document Purpose and Authority

### Purpose

This document serves as the **single canonical decision artifact** for authorizing or denying phase transitions within the TRIZEL system.

**All phase transitions must be explicitly authorized through this decision record.**

No phase transition may occur through technical implementation, convenience, gradual feature expansion, or any means other than explicit governance authorization documented in this record.

### Authority

This document operates under **Layer-0 (Governance)** authority and is binding across all TRIZEL repositories, layers, and operational contexts.

**Authority Scope:**
- Authorize phase transitions from one phase to another
- Deny phase transition requests
- Defer phase transition decisions pending additional evidence
- Freeze current phase state indefinitely
- Establish preconditions that must be met before transitions
- Define scope boundaries for what is authorized and forbidden
- Enforce non-bypass clauses across all domains

### Classification

**Governance Decision Artifact** — Declarative, constitutional, and binding in nature.

This document is **governance-only** and contains **no code, workflows, automation, execution, analysis, dashboards, APIs, or live data**.

## II. Decision Records

### Decision ID: PTD-001

**Target_Transition:** PHASE_E → PHASE_F  
**Decision_Action:** **REJECT**

**Rationale:**
Phase F is explicitly **NOT AUTHORIZED** under current governance constraints. Phase E operates as the Scientific Observatory (Read-Only) phase, and no transition beyond Phase E has been approved by governance authority.

**Preconditions:**
N/A — Transition is rejected; no preconditions apply.

**Evidence_References:**
- `governance/PHASE_E_ACTIVATION.md` — Canonical Phase E declaration
- `governance/FREEZE.md` — Scientific authorization freeze status
- `governance/LAYER1_GOVERNANCE_DECLARATION.md` — Layer-1 governance boundaries

**Scope_Boundaries:**

**Authorized:**
- NONE — No Phase F concepts, features, or implementations are authorized

**Explicitly_Forbidden:**
- Any transition to Phase F or any phase beyond Phase E
- Implementation of Phase F features under different naming
- Gradual introduction of Phase F characteristics
- Planning or preparation for Phase F activation
- Use of Phase F terminology in operational contexts
- Any technical, editorial, or procedural bypass of this rejection

**Non_Authorization_Clause:**

**This decision does NOT authorize:**
- Future consideration of Phase F
- Research or analysis into Phase F feasibility
- Technical preparation for Phase F implementation
- Documentation describing Phase F capabilities
- Any activity that assumes eventual Phase F activation

**Phase F may only be considered through a future, separate governance decision that explicitly supersedes this rejection.**

**No_Bypass_Clause:**

**Technical Bypass — PROHIBITED:**
- No technical implementation may circumvent this decision
- No feature may be introduced that effectively implements Phase F under different naming
- No architectural changes may prepare for or assume Phase F activation
- No code, APIs, automation, or execution pipelines may be added in anticipation of Phase F

**Editorial Bypass — PROHIBITED:**
- No documentation may describe Phase F as "planned," "upcoming," or "future"
- No language may suggest Phase F is under active consideration
- No terminology may imply Phase F transition is inevitable or expected
- All references to Phase F must be conditional and governance-controlled

**Procedural Bypass — PROHIBITED:**
- No process may assume Phase F activation without explicit governance approval
- No workflow may be structured to facilitate future Phase F transition
- No operational procedure may treat Phase F as a planned state
- No decision-making may proceed on the assumption of Phase F authorization

**Sign_Off:**

**Roles:**
- TRIZEL Governance (Layer-0)

**Signatures:**
- Governance Authority: TRIZEL Layer-0 Governance

**Dates:**
- Decision Date: 2026-01-21

**Change_Control:**

**Amendment_Rules:**
This decision may only be amended through:
1. Formal governance proposal submitted to Layer-0 authority
2. Comprehensive impact analysis of proposed phase transition
3. Explicit governance review and approval process
4. Documentation of decision rationale and evidence
5. Version-controlled update to this decision record

1. A new governance declaration explicitly authorizing Phase F
2. Layer-0 governance authority issuing a formal phase transition approval
3. Documentation in this record of the supersession with clear rationale
4. Preservation of historical decision record for audit trail

**No supersession may occur through technical implementation, convenience arguments, or gradual erosion of boundaries.**

**Editorial Bypass — PROHIBITED:**
- Renaming forbidden features to make them sound acceptable
- Describing prohibited capabilities in euphemistic terms
- Suggesting that Phase E restrictions are temporary or negotiable
- Implying that convenience or efficiency overrides governance

**Procedural Bypass — PROHIBITED:**

5. No emergency override or technical shortcut permitted

---

## III. Default Phase States

### Current Phase Status

**PHASE_E:** AUTHORIZED — ACTIVE  
**PHASE_F:** NOT AUTHORIZED — EXPLICITLY REJECTED

### Default Authorization State

**All phases not explicitly authorized in this decision record are NOT AUTHORIZED by default.**

No phase may be assumed to be authorized, planned, or under consideration unless explicitly documented in this decision record with a governance-approved decision.

**Fail-Closed Policy:**
In the absence of explicit authorization, the system defaults to the most restrictive state. No phase transition may proceed without documented governance approval.
