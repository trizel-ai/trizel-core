## 1. Authorization Statement

This document constitutes a **formal and limited display authorization** granted under the TRIZEL governance system.

It authorizes **Layer-2 (Presentation/Public Site) read-only display** of institutional information related to the **3I/ATLAS program**, strictly within the scope defined below.
