## Document Purpose

This document serves as a **governance-declarative, non-operational record** for Layer-1 terminology compliance.

**This document**:
- Is non-executable
- Has no operational effect
- Contains no code or algorithms
- Does not authorize any activity
- Documents correct terminology usage only

## Terminology Compliance Statement

This document complies with `DEPRECATED_TERMS.md` and uses only approved terminology.

### Historical Context

Historical non-operational reference to deprecated concepts has been removed completely from TRIZEL governance.

All Layer-1 documentation now uses only approved, governance-safe terminology:

**Algorithm Names:**
- **"AUTO DZ ACT"** - Canonical algorithm name (exact spacing and capitalization required)

**Methodological Terms:**
- **"Epistemic analysis frame"** - Methodological construct (not "theory")

**Conceptual References:**
- **"Historical non-operational reference"** - Replacement for deprecated conceptual references
- **"Layer-1"** - Research documentation and epistemic analysis layer

### Prohibited Terms

Per `DEPRECATED_TERMS.md`, the following types of terms are permanently forbidden and have been removed:
- Deprecated terminology from historical frameworks
- Deprecated version label ranges
- Theoretical lineage references
- Versioned system labels

This document contains ZERO instances of prohibited terminology.

## Layer-1 Governance Context

Layer-1 in TRIZEL operates under:
- **SYSTEM FREEZE** (active by default)
- **Authorization requirement** (SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001 currently active for 3I/ATLAS epistemic analysis)*
- **Internal-only scope** (no publication, no public release)
- **Non-interpretive stance** (governance provides structure, not scientific claims)

*Note: Authorization identifier preserves original form per governance ledger Section IV. The authorized activity is correctly termed "epistemic analysis frame."
