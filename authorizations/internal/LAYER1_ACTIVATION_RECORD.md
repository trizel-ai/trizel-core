## IV. Layer-2 Status Confirmation

**LAYER-2 REMAINS LOCKED**

This activation explicitly confirms:

### 4.1 No Layer-2 Activation
- ❌ Website remains non-operational for scientific content
- ❌ Documentation site remains governance-only
- ❌ No DNS configuration changes
- ❌ No public access pathways created
- ❌ No presentation layer modifications

### 4.2 Layer-2 Firewall Maintained
- All Layer-1 outputs remain in `authorizations/internal/`
- No migration pathways to public directories
- No symbolic links or references to Layer-1 content in public areas
- Strict separation between internal analysis and public presentation

### 4.3 Future Layer-2 Activation
**Separate, explicit Layer-2 activation PR required for any public presentation**

Layer-2 activation would require:
1. Separate governance decision
2. Explicit Layer-2 authorization document
3. Independent PR with Layer-2 scope
4. Additional governance review and approval
5. Registration as separate governance event

**This PR does NOT constitute Layer-2 authorization.**

---

## V. Governance Authority Confirmation

### 5.1 Primary Authority
**Source:** docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md  
**Status:** SUPREME AND UNCHANGED

This activation:
- Derives all authority from the Governance Ledger
- Does not modify governance rules
- Does not override Layer-0 authority
- Does not create new governance pathways

### 5.2 Authorization Framework
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001  
**Document:** docs/authorizations/SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001.md  
**Status:** ACTIVE (consumed by this activation)

This activation operates exclusively under:
- Scope defined in SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001
- Prohibitions stated in SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001
- Governance framework established in TRIZEL Governance Ledger

### 5.3 SYSTEM FREEZE Status
**Status:** ACTIVE AND UNCHANGED

The global SYSTEM FREEZE declared in Section II of the Governance Ledger remains:
- Fully active for all scientific publication
- Binding for all external communication
- Enforced for all Layer-1 outputs
- Unchanged by this activation

**Key Principle:** Analysis may be conducted internally. Publication is not authorized.

## VII. Operational Framework

### 7.1 LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL Usage

**Authorization Status:** AUTHORIZED FOR OPERATIONAL USE

The document `authorizations/internal/LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md`:
- Remains structurally a template document (per its own designation)
- Is now **AUTHORIZED FOR OPERATIONAL USE** under this activation
- Provides authoritative structural framework for Layer-1 activities
- Defines the epistemic analysis workflow to be followed
- Establishes input/output requirements for all Layer-1 work

**Clarification:** This activation authorizes operational use of the LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md template for Layer-1 activities under SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001.

### 7.2 Laboratory Structure

**Directory:** `authorizations/internal/lab/`

**Status:** OPERATIONAL

**Structure:**
- `concepts/` — Theoretical concept definitions
- `constraints/` — Logical and physical constraints
- `hypotheses/` — Hypothesis generation and documentation
- `models/` — Conceptual model development
- `references/` — ORCID-verified publication references

### 7.3 Internal Working Notes

**Status:** AUTHORIZED

Internal working notes may now be created following the structure established in:
- `INTERNAL_WORKING_NOTE_3I_ATLAS_001.md` (existing example)
- Future working notes under SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001 scope

**Requirements:**
- Must include governance disclaimers
- Must reference authorization chain
- Must classify as INTERNAL — NON-PUBLISHABLE
- Must remain in `authorizations/internal/`

---

## VIII. Revocation and Modification

### 8.1 Revocation Authority

This activation may be **REVOKED** at any time by:

### 8.2 Revocation Consequences

If this activation is revoked:
1. All Layer-1 activities must cease immediately
2. No new internal analysis may be conducted
3. Existing internal documents remain but are marked REVOKED
4. LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL is no longer authorized for operational use
5. Revocation is recorded as governance event

### 8.3 Modification Prohibition

**This activation record cannot be modified once issued.**

Changes to Layer-1 operations require:
- New activation record with updated scope
- Registration as separate governance event
- Explicit governance approval
