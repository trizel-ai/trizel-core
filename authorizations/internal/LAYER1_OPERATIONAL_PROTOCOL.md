## ⚠️ CRITICAL GOVERNANCE DISCLAIMER ⚠️

**THIS IS A TEMPLATE DOCUMENT ONLY**

This file is a **reusable template** for future Layer-1 epistemic analysis records. It is **NOT** an operational protocol, active authorization, or execution trigger.

### Template Status Declaration

1. **NO LAYER-1 ACTIVITY IS INITIATED** by this template
2. **NO EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED** by this template
3. **NO AUTHORIZATION IS CONSUMED** by this template
4. **NO GOVERNANCE EVENT IS REGISTERED** by this template

### Template Classification

- **Meta-Governance Artifact:** This template defines structure for future records
- **Non-Executable:** This template does not execute, activate, or trigger any processes
- **Non-Binding:** This template does not create obligations or authorizations
- **Non-Operational:** This template is documentation infrastructure only

### Future Use Requirement

**To create an actual Layer-1 epistemic analysis record:**
- A separate, explicitly authorized pull request MUST be submitted
- That PR MUST reference a valid scientific authorization (e.g., SA-XXX-XXX-XXX)
- That PR MUST be approved through governance review
- That PR MUST instantiate this template with specific operational details

**This template itself:**
- Does NOT activate Layer-1 analysis capabilities
- Does NOT grant permission for epistemic analysis
- Does NOT constitute a governance event
- Does NOT modify SYSTEM FREEZE status

### Governance Authority

All actual Layer-1 operational records derive authority from:
- **Primary Authority:** `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md`
- **Specific Authorization:** Must be explicitly cited in implementing PR
- **Governance Framework:** TRIZEL Layer-0 (Governance & Charter)

**This template is subordinate to the Governance Ledger and does NOT grant authority.**

### SYSTEM FREEZE Confirmation

The global **SYSTEM FREEZE** declared in the TRIZEL Governance Ledger remains **FULLY ACTIVE AND UNCHANGED**.

This template:
- Does NOT create an exception to SYSTEM FREEZE
- Does NOT authorize publication
- Does NOT authorize scientific activity
- Does NOT modify freeze enforcement

---

## Template Purpose

This template defines the **structural framework for future operational protocols** for Layer-1 activities within the TRIZEL governance framework. Layer-1 encompasses internal epistemic analysis—structured theoretical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and conceptual framework development conducted strictly within governance boundaries.

**When instantiated in an authorized PR, this template becomes documentation only.** Instantiated protocols do not authorize execution, do not define workflows for computational systems, and do not establish publication pathways.

---

## I. Scope and Authority of Layer-1 (Template Framework)

### 1.1 Definition

**Layer-1** is the **Internal Epistemic Analysis** layer within the TRIZEL epistemic pipeline. It serves as the structured reasoning space where theoretical frameworks, hypotheses, and conceptual models are developed, documented, and organized under strict governance control.

Layer-1 operates exclusively as a **documentation and analysis** layer, not an execution layer.

**This template defines the structural framework for Layer-1 operational protocols.** Individual operational protocols must be instantiated through authorized PRs.

### 1.2 Authority (For Instantiated Protocols)

When this template is instantiated in an authorized PR, the resulting protocol derives authority from:

- **Primary Authority:** `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md`
- **Specific Authorization:** Must be explicitly cited (e.g., SA-XXX-XXX-XXX)
- **Governance Framework:** TRIZEL Layer-0 (Governance & Charter)

**This template itself does not grant authority.** Authority is granted only through proper instantiation in an authorized PR.

All Layer-1 activities under instantiated protocols are subject to the constraints, prohibitions, and requirements defined in the governance ledger and specific authorization documents.

### 1.3 Relationship to SYSTEM FREEZE

The global **SYSTEM FREEZE** remains **FULLY ACTIVE**. 

**This template:**
- Does NOT create an exception to SYSTEM FREEZE
- Does NOT authorize Layer-1 activities
- Does NOT modify freeze enforcement
- Provides structural framework for future authorized exceptions only

**When properly instantiated:** Layer-1 activities represent a narrow, controlled exception for internal analysis only. Instantiated protocols do not lift, modify, or weaken the SYSTEM FREEZE in any way.

**Key Principle:** Analysis may be permitted under proper authorization. Publication is not.

### 1.4 Layer-1 Boundaries (Template Definition)

**Layer-1 includes (when authorized):**
- Theoretical reasoning and hypothesis generation
- Mathematical and conceptual modeling
- Epistemic analysis frame development
- Logical consistency evaluation
- Internal documentation of analytical work

**Layer-1 excludes (always):**
- Data acquisition or observational activity
- Computational execution or model training
- Experimental validation or performance testing
- Scientific publication or external communication
- Claims of validated findings or physical truth

---

## II. Permitted Inputs: ORCID-Linked Publications Only

### 2.1 Input Authority Model

All scientific references ingested into Layer-1 analysis **must** originate from **ORCID-verified sources** as defined in Section V of the TRIZEL Governance Ledger.

**ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)** provides:
- Persistent researcher identification
- Verified publication records
- Authoritative attribution
- Traceability to source material

### 2.2 Compliant Input Sources

**Acceptable sources for Layer-1 analysis:**

1. **ORCID-linked publications** — Publications verified in researcher ORCID records
2. **DOI-identified publications** — Publications with Digital Object Identifiers linked to ORCID authors
3. **Institutional repositories** — When linked to ORCID-verified researchers
4. **Explicitly authorized exceptions** — Only when documented in the authorizing governance document (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001)

### 2.3 Prohibited Input Sources

Unless explicitly authorized, the following are **NOT acceptable inputs**:

- Personal websites or blogs without ORCID verification
- Unverified preprint servers
- Social media posts or informal communications
- News articles or press releases
- Secondary citations without source verification
- Proprietary or embargoed datasets
- Privately shared materials without authorization
- Observational data acquired for this analysis

### 2.4 Input Documentation Requirements

Each input reference must be documented with:

- **ORCID identifier** of the source researcher
- **DOI or publication identifier** (when available)
- **Publication title and metadata** (journal, date, authors)
- **Date of ingestion** into Layer-1 analysis
- **Authorization reference** permitting ingestion
- **Internal storage location** (e.g., `authorizations/internal/lab/references/`)

**Traceability Chain:**
```
ORCID Record → Publication → Internal Reference → Layer-1 Analysis
```

### 2.5 Interpretation Neutrality

**Critical Principle:** Ingestion of ORCID-linked publications does NOT imply:
- Endorsement of scientific conclusions
- Validation of methodologies
- Assertion of correctness
- Preference between competing models
- TRIZEL interpretation of results

**ORCID references establish provenance only.** TRIZEL remains interpretation-neutral.

## IV. Epistemic Analysis Workflow

### 4.1 Workflow Purpose

This section defines the **conceptual workflow** for conducting epistemic analysis within Layer-1. This is a documentation and reasoning framework, not a computational or automated system.

**Key Principle:** This workflow organizes human reasoning, not machine execution.

### 4.2 Epistemic Analysis Components

Layer-1 epistemic analysis consists of structured exploration across the following components:

#### A. Concepts
- Identification and definition of key theoretical concepts
- Clarification of terminology and semantic boundaries
- Establishment of conceptual relationships
- Documentation of conceptual dependencies

#### B. Hypotheses
- Generation of testable or evaluable hypotheses
- Documentation of hypothesis scope and assumptions
- Identification of logical consequences
- Exploration of hypothesis relationships (complementary, competing, nested)

#### C. Constraints
- Identification of logical constraints on hypothesis space
- Documentation of known physical constraints (from ORCID-linked sources)
- Establishment of consistency requirements
- Recognition of analytical limitations

### 4.3 Epistemic Analysis Process

**Step 1: Input Ingestion and Documentation**
- Identify ORCID-linked sources relevant to analysis scope
- Verify ORCID records and publication metadata
- Document sources in `authorizations/internal/lab/references/`
- Record traceability chain

**Step 2: Conceptual Framework Development**
- Define key concepts from ingested sources
- Establish relationships between concepts
- Document in `authorizations/internal/lab/concepts/`
- Maintain conceptual clarity and avoid interpretation overreach

**Step 3: Hypothesis Generation**
- Formulate hypotheses within authorized scope
- Document hypothesis structure, assumptions, and scope
- Store in `authorizations/internal/lab/hypotheses/`
- Clearly label as speculative, non-validated, exploratory

**Step 4: Constraint Identification**
- Identify logical, mathematical, or physical constraints
- Document constraint sources (ORCID references or logical necessity)
- Record in `authorizations/internal/lab/constraints/`
- Distinguish between hard constraints and methodological preferences

**Step 5: Consistency Analysis**
- Evaluate internal logical consistency of hypotheses
- Assess compatibility between hypotheses and constraints
- Document tensions, contradictions, or degeneracies
- Avoid claims of validation or experimental confirmation

**Step 6: Documentation and Internal Review**
- Compile analysis into internal working notes
- Ensure governance compliance (disclaimers, scope boundaries)
- Store in `authorizations/internal/`
- Mark as **INTERNAL WORKING DOCUMENT — NON-PUBLISHABLE**

### 4.4 Workflow Constraints

This workflow is **not**:
- An execution pipeline
- An automated system
- A publication pathway
- A scientific validation process

This workflow **is**:
- A documentation framework
- A reasoning structure
- An organizational tool for internal analysis
- A governance-compliant analytical approach

---

## V. Output Classification

### 5.1 Classification Requirement

All outputs generated through Layer-1 epistemic analysis **must be classified** according to their governance status and intended use.

**Classification is mandatory.** No Layer-1 output may exist without clear classification.

### 5.2 Output Categories

#### Category 1: Internal Working Documents
**Definition:** Preliminary analysis, exploratory reasoning, hypothesis generation

**Characteristics:**
- Strictly internal use only
- Non-validated, non-final
- Subject to revision or retraction
- Contains epistemic uncertainty and speculation

**Label Requirement:** Documents must include:
```
INTERNAL WORKING DOCUMENT — NON-PUBLISHABLE
```

**Storage Location:** `authorizations/internal/`

**Governance Status:** Compliant with SYSTEM FREEZE (no publication)

---

#### Category 2: Draft Analysis (Governance-Controlled)
**Definition:** Structured analysis with enhanced documentation, prepared for potential governance review

**Characteristics:**
- More rigorous than working documents
- Still non-published, non-validated
- Subject to governance oversight
- May be reviewed internally for compliance

**Label Requirement:** Documents must include:
```
DRAFT ANALYSIS — INTERNAL ONLY — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR PUBLICATION
```

**Storage Location:** `authorizations/internal/` with subdirectory structure

**Governance Status:** Compliant with SYSTEM FREEZE (no publication)

---

#### Category 3: Non-Publishable Reference Material
**Definition:** Organized reference material, ingested from ORCID sources, used to inform analysis

**Characteristics:**
- Compilation of external references
- ORCID-verified sources only
- Attribution and provenance clearly documented
- No TRIZEL interpretation added

**Label Requirement:** Documents must include:
```
REFERENCE MATERIAL — ORCID-VERIFIED SOURCES — NOT TRIZEL OUTPUT
```

**Storage Location:** `authorizations/internal/lab/references/`

**Governance Status:** Compliant (reference compilation, not scientific output)

---

### 5.3 Prohibited Output Categories

The following output classifications are **NOT authorized** under Layer-1:

- **Published Scientific Output** — Forbidden under SYSTEM FREEZE
- **Public Scientific Communication** — Forbidden under SYSTEM FREEZE
- **Validated Findings** — Layer-1 does not validate
- **DOI-Registered Content** — Forbidden under SYSTEM FREEZE
- **Zenodo Deposits** — Forbidden under SYSTEM FREEZE

### 5.4 Classification Enforcement

**All Layer-1 outputs must:**
- Display classification label prominently at document start
- Include governance disclaimers
- Reference authorizing document (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001)
- State relationship to SYSTEM FREEZE
- Provide traceability to governance ledger

**Pull requests introducing Layer-1 outputs must:**
- Confirm output classification in PR description
- Document compliance with prohibitions
- Reference this protocol document
- Pass governance enforcement CI checks

---

## VI. Freeze Enforcement Clause

### 6.1 SYSTEM FREEZE Status

The **SYSTEM FREEZE** declared in the TRIZEL Governance Ledger remains **FULLY ACTIVE** and **binding** for all Layer-1 activities.

**SYSTEM FREEZE Declaration Reference:**
- Primary Authority: `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md` (Section II)
- Freeze Declaration: `docs/FREEZE_DECLARATION.md`
- Scientific Authorization Framework: `governance/SCIENTIFIC_AUTHORIZATION_FRAMEWORK.md`

### 6.2 Layer-1 Freeze Compliance

**What Layer-1 MAY do under the freeze:**
- Internal epistemic analysis (documentation only)
- Hypothesis generation and conceptual framework development
- ORCID-verified reference ingestion
- Logical consistency evaluation
- Internal working document creation

**What Layer-1 MAY NOT do under the freeze:**
- Publication of scientific findings
- Public dissemination of analysis
- DOI minting or Zenodo archiving
- Citation generation as scientific output
- Claims of validated or confirmed results
- Execution of scientific models for publication
- External scientific communication as TRIZEL output

### 6.3 Authorization-Limited Exception

Layer-1 activities are permitted **only under explicit written authorization** (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001).

**Authorization boundaries are strict:**
- Scope is defined and immutable within authorization document
- Activities outside defined scope are prohibited
- No implicit expansion of authorization is permitted
- Authorizations may be revoked without notice

### 6.4 Enforcement Mechanisms

**Freeze compliance is enforced through:**

1. **Governance Review** — All Layer-1 PRs subject to governance compliance checks
2. **CI Automation** — Automated checks for deprecated terms, governance violations
3. **Manual Review** — Human reviewers verify scope compliance, classification correctness
4. **Traceability Requirements** — All Layer-1 work traceable to authorizing document

### 6.5 Violation Response

**Freeze violations trigger:**
- Immediate PR rejection or content removal
- Governance incident documentation
- Potential authorization revocation
- Review of authorization scope adequacy

**Repeated violations may result in:**
- Permanent authorization revocation
- Enhanced oversight requirements
- Structural changes to Layer-1 protocol

### 6.6 Immutability of Freeze

The SYSTEM FREEZE may be modified **only by Layer-0 governance authority** through formal governance decision recorded in the TRIZEL Governance Ledger.

**Layer-1 activities cannot:**
- Modify the freeze
- Create exceptions to the freeze
- Weaken freeze enforcement
- Establish alternative publication pathways

**This protocol is subordinate to the SYSTEM FREEZE and the Governance Ledger.**

---

## VII. Ledger Traceability (Framework for Instantiated Protocols)

### 7.1 Traceability Requirement

**This template establishes the traceability framework.** When properly instantiated, all Layer-1 activities, outputs, and decisions **must be traceable** to authoritative governance documentation.

**Traceability ensures:**
- Accountability for governance compliance
- Audit trail for authorization scope adherence
- Historical record of analytical work
- Verification of ORCID input provenance

### 7.2 Required Traceability Links (For Instantiated Protocols)

Every Layer-1 document or output created under an instantiated protocol must explicitly reference:

1. **Governance Ledger**
   - Primary authority: `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md`
   - Relevant ledger sections cited

2. **Authorization Document**
   - Specific authorization ID (e.g., SA-XXX-XXX-XXX)
   - Full path to authorization document
   - Effective date and status

3. **SYSTEM FREEZE Status**
   - Acknowledgment of active freeze
   - Statement of compliance
   - Confirmation of non-publication status

4. **ORCID Provenance** (for reference materials)
   - ORCID identifier of source researcher
   - DOI or publication identifier
   - Date of ingestion
   - Storage location

**This template itself:** Does not create traceability obligations until instantiated in an authorized PR.

### 7.3 Traceability Chain Documentation (Template Format)

**Format for traceability documentation in instantiated protocols:**

```
GOVERNANCE TRACEABILITY
├── Governance Authority: docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md
├── Authorization: [SPECIFIC-AUTH-ID] (path/to/authorization.md)
├── SYSTEM FREEZE: ACTIVE (compliant, no publication authorized)
├── Operational Protocol: [Instantiated from LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md template]
└── ORCID Provenance: [when applicable] authorizations/internal/lab/references/
```

### 7.4 Ledger Event Recording

Significant Layer-1 activities under instantiated protocols may be recorded in the **Governance Event Ledger** (Section VI of TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md) when they:

- Represent major structural changes to Layer-1 organization
- Involve authorization scope modifications
- Result in governance compliance incidents
- Establish precedent for future Layer-1 work

**Event recording is governance responsibility, not Layer-1 responsibility.**

Layer-1 outputs should note potential ledger-recording events in their documentation but do not independently create ledger entries.

**This template:** Creating or updating this template is NOT a ledger event. Only instantiation in authorized PRs or significant governance changes constitute events.

### 7.5 Audit and Verification (For Instantiated Protocols)

**Governance audits may verify:**
- Correct traceability links in all Layer-1 documents
- Consistency between Layer-1 work and authorizing scope
- ORCID verification for all ingested references
- Proper output classification and labeling
- Compliance with SYSTEM FREEZE prohibitions

**Traceability failures require:**
- Immediate correction
- Documentation update
- Potential governance review of affected outputs

### 7.6 Traceability Maintenance (For Instantiated Protocols)

**Responsible parties:**
- Authors of Layer-1 documents must establish initial traceability
- Reviewers must verify traceability correctness before PR approval
- Governance authorities may audit traceability periodically

**Traceability is non-negotiable for instantiated protocols.** Documents lacking proper traceability fail governance compliance and must be corrected or removed.

**This template itself:** Traceability requirements apply to instantiated protocols, not to this template document.
