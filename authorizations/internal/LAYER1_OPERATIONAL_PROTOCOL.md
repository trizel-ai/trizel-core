# Layer-1 Operational Protocol
## Internal Epistemic Analysis Framework

**Repository:** trizel-ai/trizel-core  
**Document Type:** Operational Protocol (Documentation Only)  
**Layer:** Layer-1 (Internal Epistemic Analysis)  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Governance Authority:** docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md  
**Authorization Reference:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Document Purpose

This document defines the **operational protocol for Layer-1 activities** within the TRIZEL governance framework. Layer-1 encompasses internal epistemic analysis—structured theoretical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and conceptual framework development conducted strictly within governance boundaries.

**This is documentation only.** This protocol does not authorize execution, does not define workflows for computational systems, and does not establish publication pathways.

---

## I. Scope and Authority of Layer-1

### 1.1 Definition

**Layer-1** is the **Internal Epistemic Analysis** layer within the TRIZEL epistemic pipeline. It serves as the structured reasoning space where theoretical frameworks, hypotheses, and conceptual models are developed, documented, and organized under strict governance control.

Layer-1 operates exclusively as a **documentation and analysis** layer, not an execution layer.

### 1.2 Authority

Layer-1 derives its authority from:

- **Primary Authority:** `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md`
- **Specific Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001
- **Governance Framework:** TRIZEL Layer-0 (Governance & Charter)

All Layer-1 activities are subject to the constraints, prohibitions, and requirements defined in the governance ledger and specific authorization documents.

### 1.3 Relationship to SYSTEM FREEZE

The global **SYSTEM FREEZE** remains **FULLY ACTIVE**. Layer-1 activities represent a narrow, controlled exception for internal analysis only. This protocol does not lift, modify, or weaken the SYSTEM FREEZE in any way.

**Key Principle:** Analysis is permitted. Publication is not.

### 1.4 Layer-1 Boundaries

**Layer-1 includes:**
- Theoretical reasoning and hypothesis generation
- Mathematical and conceptual modeling
- Epistemic analysis frame development
- Logical consistency evaluation
- Internal documentation of analytical work

**Layer-1 excludes:**
- Data acquisition or observational activity
- Computational execution or model training
- Experimental validation or performance testing
- Scientific publication or external communication
- Claims of validated findings or physical truth

---

## II. Permitted Inputs: ORCID-Linked Publications Only

### 2.1 Input Authority Model

All scientific references ingested into Layer-1 analysis **must** originate from **ORCID-verified sources** as defined in Section V of the TRIZEL Governance Ledger.

**ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)** provides:
- Persistent researcher identification
- Verified publication records
- Authoritative attribution
- Traceability to source material

### 2.2 Compliant Input Sources

**Acceptable sources for Layer-1 analysis:**

1. **ORCID-linked publications** — Publications verified in researcher ORCID records
2. **DOI-identified publications** — Publications with Digital Object Identifiers linked to ORCID authors
3. **Institutional repositories** — When linked to ORCID-verified researchers
4. **Explicitly authorized exceptions** — Only when documented in the authorizing governance document (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001)

### 2.3 Prohibited Input Sources

Unless explicitly authorized, the following are **NOT acceptable inputs**:

- Personal websites or blogs without ORCID verification
- Unverified preprint servers
- Social media posts or informal communications
- News articles or press releases
- Secondary citations without source verification
- Proprietary or embargoed datasets
- Privately shared materials without authorization
- Observational data acquired for this analysis

### 2.4 Input Documentation Requirements

Each input reference must be documented with:

- **ORCID identifier** of the source researcher
- **DOI or publication identifier** (when available)
- **Publication title and metadata** (journal, date, authors)
- **Date of ingestion** into Layer-1 analysis
- **Authorization reference** permitting ingestion
- **Internal storage location** (e.g., `authorizations/internal/lab/references/`)

**Traceability Chain:**
```
ORCID Record → Publication → Internal Reference → Layer-1 Analysis
```

### 2.5 Interpretation Neutrality

**Critical Principle:** Ingestion of ORCID-linked publications does NOT imply:
- Endorsement of scientific conclusions
- Validation of methodologies
- Assertion of correctness
- Preference between competing models
- TRIZEL interpretation of results

**ORCID references establish provenance only.** TRIZEL remains interpretation-neutral.

## IV. Epistemic Analysis Workflow

### 4.1 Workflow Purpose

This section defines the **conceptual workflow** for conducting epistemic analysis within Layer-1. This is a documentation and reasoning framework, not a computational or automated system.

**Key Principle:** This workflow organizes human reasoning, not machine execution.

### 4.2 Epistemic Analysis Components

Layer-1 epistemic analysis consists of structured exploration across the following components:

#### A. Concepts
- Identification and definition of key theoretical concepts
- Clarification of terminology and semantic boundaries
- Establishment of conceptual relationships
- Documentation of conceptual dependencies

#### B. Hypotheses
- Generation of testable or evaluable hypotheses
- Documentation of hypothesis scope and assumptions
- Identification of logical consequences
- Exploration of hypothesis relationships (complementary, competing, nested)

#### C. Constraints
- Identification of logical constraints on hypothesis space
- Documentation of known physical constraints (from ORCID-linked sources)
- Establishment of consistency requirements
- Recognition of analytical limitations

### 4.3 Epistemic Analysis Process

**Step 1: Input Ingestion and Documentation**
- Identify ORCID-linked sources relevant to analysis scope
- Verify ORCID records and publication metadata
- Document sources in `authorizations/internal/lab/references/`
- Record traceability chain

**Step 2: Conceptual Framework Development**
- Define key concepts from ingested sources
- Establish relationships between concepts
- Document in `authorizations/internal/lab/concepts/`
- Maintain conceptual clarity and avoid interpretation overreach

**Step 3: Hypothesis Generation**
- Formulate hypotheses within authorized scope
- Document hypothesis structure, assumptions, and scope
- Store in `authorizations/internal/lab/hypotheses/`
- Clearly label as speculative, non-validated, exploratory

**Step 4: Constraint Identification**
- Identify logical, mathematical, or physical constraints
- Document constraint sources (ORCID references or logical necessity)
- Record in `authorizations/internal/lab/constraints/`
- Distinguish between hard constraints and methodological preferences

**Step 5: Consistency Analysis**
- Evaluate internal logical consistency of hypotheses
- Assess compatibility between hypotheses and constraints
- Document tensions, contradictions, or degeneracies
- Avoid claims of validation or experimental confirmation

**Step 6: Documentation and Internal Review**
- Compile analysis into internal working notes
- Ensure governance compliance (disclaimers, scope boundaries)
- Store in `authorizations/internal/`
- Mark as **INTERNAL WORKING DOCUMENT — NON-PUBLISHABLE**

### 4.4 Workflow Constraints

This workflow is **not**:
- An execution pipeline
- An automated system
- A publication pathway
- A scientific validation process

This workflow **is**:
- A documentation framework
- A reasoning structure
- An organizational tool for internal analysis
- A governance-compliant analytical approach

---

## VI. Freeze Enforcement Clause

### 6.1 SYSTEM FREEZE Status

The **SYSTEM FREEZE** declared in the TRIZEL Governance Ledger remains **FULLY ACTIVE** and **binding** for all Layer-1 activities.

**SYSTEM FREEZE Declaration Reference:**
- Primary Authority: `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md` (Section II)
- Freeze Declaration: `docs/FREEZE_DECLARATION.md`
- Scientific Authorization Framework: `governance/SCIENTIFIC_AUTHORIZATION_FRAMEWORK.md`

### 6.2 Layer-1 Freeze Compliance

**What Layer-1 MAY do under the freeze:**
- Internal epistemic analysis (documentation only)
- Hypothesis generation and conceptual framework development
- ORCID-verified reference ingestion
- Logical consistency evaluation
- Internal working document creation

**What Layer-1 MAY NOT do under the freeze:**
- Publication of scientific findings
- Public dissemination of analysis
- DOI minting or Zenodo archiving
- Citation generation as scientific output
- Claims of validated or confirmed results
- Execution of scientific models for publication
- External scientific communication as TRIZEL output

### 6.3 Authorization-Limited Exception

Layer-1 activities are permitted **only under explicit written authorization** (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001).

**Authorization boundaries are strict:**
- Scope is defined and immutable within authorization document
- Activities outside defined scope are prohibited
- No implicit expansion of authorization is permitted
- Authorizations may be revoked without notice

### 6.4 Enforcement Mechanisms

**Freeze compliance is enforced through:**

1. **Governance Review** — All Layer-1 PRs subject to governance compliance checks
2. **CI Automation** — Automated checks for deprecated terms, governance violations
3. **Manual Review** — Human reviewers verify scope compliance, classification correctness
4. **Traceability Requirements** — All Layer-1 work traceable to authorizing document

### 6.5 Violation Response

**Freeze violations trigger:**
- Immediate PR rejection or content removal
- Governance incident documentation
- Potential authorization revocation
- Review of authorization scope adequacy

**Repeated violations may result in:**
- Permanent authorization revocation
- Enhanced oversight requirements
- Structural changes to Layer-1 protocol

### 6.6 Immutability of Freeze

The SYSTEM FREEZE may be modified **only by Layer-0 governance authority** through formal governance decision recorded in the TRIZEL Governance Ledger.

**Layer-1 activities cannot:**
- Modify the freeze
- Create exceptions to the freeze
- Weaken freeze enforcement
- Establish alternative publication pathways

**This protocol is subordinate to the SYSTEM FREEZE and the Governance Ledger.**

---

## VII. Ledger Traceability

### 7.1 Traceability Requirement

All Layer-1 activities, outputs, and decisions **must be traceable** to authoritative governance documentation.

**Traceability ensures:**
- Accountability for governance compliance
- Audit trail for authorization scope adherence
- Historical record of analytical work
- Verification of ORCID input provenance

### 7.2 Required Traceability Links

Every Layer-1 document or output must explicitly reference:

1. **Governance Ledger**
   - Primary authority: `docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md`
   - Relevant ledger sections cited

2. **Authorization Document**
   - Specific authorization ID (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001)
   - Full path to authorization document
   - Effective date and status

3. **SYSTEM FREEZE Status**
   - Acknowledgment of active freeze
   - Statement of compliance
   - Confirmation of non-publication status

4. **ORCID Provenance** (for reference materials)
   - ORCID identifier of source researcher
   - DOI or publication identifier
   - Date of ingestion
   - Storage location

### 7.3 Traceability Chain Documentation

**Format for traceability documentation:**

```
GOVERNANCE TRACEABILITY
├── Governance Authority: docs/governance/TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md
├── Authorization: SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001 (docs/authorizations/SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001.md)
├── SYSTEM FREEZE: ACTIVE (compliant, no publication authorized)
├── Operational Protocol: authorizations/internal/LAYER1_OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL.md
└── ORCID Provenance: [when applicable] authorizations/internal/lab/references/
```

### 7.4 Ledger Event Recording

Significant Layer-1 activities may be recorded in the **Governance Event Ledger** (Section VI of TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md) when they:

- Represent major structural changes to Layer-1 organization
- Involve authorization scope modifications
- Result in governance compliance incidents
- Establish precedent for future Layer-1 work

**Event recording is governance responsibility, not Layer-1 responsibility.**

Layer-1 outputs should note potential ledger-recording events in their documentation but do not independently create ledger entries.

### 7.5 Audit and Verification

**Governance audits may verify:**
- Correct traceability links in all Layer-1 documents
- Consistency between Layer-1 work and authorizing scope
- ORCID verification for all ingested references
- Proper output classification and labeling
- Compliance with SYSTEM FREEZE prohibitions

**Traceability failures require:**
- Immediate correction
- Documentation update
- Potential governance review of affected outputs

### 7.6 Traceability Maintenance

**Responsible parties:**
- Authors of Layer-1 documents must establish initial traceability
- Reviewers must verify traceability correctness before PR approval
- Governance authorities may audit traceability periodically

**Traceability is non-negotiable.** Documents lacking proper traceability fail governance compliance and must be corrected or removed.
