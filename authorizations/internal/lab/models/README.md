# Laboratory Models Layer

**Layer:** MODELS  
**Laboratory:** LAB-3I-ATLAS-001  
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Purpose

This layer stores **theoretical models and frameworks** extracted from ORCID-validated publications for application to 3I/ATLAS analysis.

## Content Structure

Each model entry MUST include:

1. **Model Name:** Clear identifier
2. **Framework Type:** Classical, Relativistic, Modified Gravity, etc.
3. **Mathematical Formulation:** Key equations or conceptual structure
4. **Source Traceability:** ORCID → Publication → Equation/Section
5. **Predictions:** What this model predicts for 3I/ATLAS
6. **Constraints:** Physical constraints and assumptions
7. **Comparison:** How model differs from alternatives

## Model Categories (Future)

Once ORCID publications are ingested, models may include:
- Orbital dynamics frameworks (Newtonian, GR, Modified Gravity)
- Non-gravitational force models (outgassing, radiation pressure)
- Composition models (icy, rocky, composite)
- Origin scenario models (ejection, disruption, galactic)

## Epistemic Approach

**No Privileged Frameworks:**
- All models evaluated on equal footing
- No theory assumed as correct a priori
- 3I/ATLAS treated as testbed for framework comparison

## Status

⚠️ **AWAITING ORCID ID**

This layer will be populated once ORCID publications are ingested and processed.

## Governance

- **Theoretical Only:** No experimental validation
- **Framework Agnostic:** No privileging of established theories
- **ORCID-Traced:** All models traceable to ORCID sources
- **Internal-Only:** Not for publication
