# Laboratory Models Layer

**Layer:** MODELS  
**Laboratory:** LAB-3I-ATLAS-001  
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Purpose

This layer stores **theoretical models and frameworks** extracted from ORCID-validated publications for application to 3I/ATLAS analysis.

## Status

✅ **READY FOR POPULATION**

ORCID publications ingested. Key models identified for extraction:
- AUTO DZ ACT v2.2 verification framework
- State-based classification system
- Physical structure models
- Thermal activity models
- Spectral analysis frameworks

## Content Structure

Each model entry MUST include:

1. **Model Name:** Clear identifier
2. **Framework Type:** Verification, Physical, Spectral, etc.
3. **Mathematical Formulation:** Key equations or conceptual structure
4. **Source Traceability:** ORCID → Publication → Equation/Section
5. **Predictions:** What this model predicts for 3I/ATLAS
6. **Constraints:** Physical constraints and assumptions
7. **Comparison:** How model differs from alternatives

## Source Publications

Models extracted from:
- [PUB001] AUTO DZ ACT v2.2 framework (methodological)
- [PUB002] Physical, thermal, and spectral models

## Epistemic Approach

**No Privileged Frameworks:**
- All models evaluated on equal footing
- No epistemic analysis frame assumed as correct a priori
- 3I/ATLAS treated as testbed for framework comparison

## Governance

- **Theoretical Only:** No experimental validation
- **Framework Agnostic:** No privileging of established epistemic analysis frames
- **ORCID-Traced:** All models traceable to ORCID sources
- **Internal-Only:** Not for publication

**Layer ready for population from ORCID-validated publications.**
