# Laboratory Hypotheses Layer

**Layer:** HYPOTHESES  
**Laboratory:** LAB-3I-ATLAS-001  
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Purpose

This layer stores **testable hypotheses** for 3I/ATLAS analysis, derived from ORCID-validated publications and theoretical frameworks.

## Status

✅ **READY FOR POPULATION**

ORCID publications ingested. Key hypothesis areas identified:
- Testability boundaries for 3I/ATLAS interpretations
- Non-cometary origin scenarios
- Alternative composition models
- Plasma event generation mechanisms
- Brightness variation explanations
- Spectral anomaly interpretations

## Content Structure

Each hypothesis entry MUST include:

1. **Hypothesis Statement:** Clear, testable statement
2. **Theoretical Basis:** Which model/framework generates this hypothesis
3. **Source Traceability:** ORCID → Publication → Theoretical Section
4. **Predictions:** Specific predictions for 3I/ATLAS properties
5. **Distinguishing Criteria:** How to differentiate from alternative hypotheses
6. **Consistency Checks:** Internal logical consistency evaluation
7. **Limitations:** What this hypothesis cannot explain

## Source Publications

Hypotheses derived from:
- [PUB001] Testability framework (AUTO DZ ACT)
- [PUB002] Anomaly-driven alternative explanations

## Testability

All hypotheses MUST be:
- **Falsifiable:** Can be proven wrong in principle
- **Testable:** Makes specific predictions
- **Logically Consistent:** No internal contradictions
- **Framework-Explicit:** Clear which epistemic analysis frame generates the hypothesis

## Governance

- **Exploratory:** Hypotheses are proposals, not validated conclusions
- **Non-Final:** All content is preliminary
- **ORCID-Traced:** Hypotheses traceable to ORCID sources
- **Internal-Only:** Not for publication

**Layer ready for population from ORCID-validated publications.**
