# Laboratory Hypotheses Layer

**Layer:** HYPOTHESES  
**Laboratory:** LAB-3I-ATLAS-001  
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Purpose

This layer stores **testable hypotheses** for 3I/ATLAS analysis, derived from ORCID-validated publications and theoretical frameworks.

## Content Structure

Each hypothesis entry MUST include:

1. **Hypothesis Statement:** Clear, testable statement
2. **Theoretical Basis:** Which model/framework generates this hypothesis
3. **Source Traceability:** ORCID → Publication → Theoretical Section
4. **Predictions:** Specific predictions for 3I/ATLAS properties
5. **Distinguishing Criteria:** How to differentiate from alternative hypotheses
6. **Consistency Checks:** Internal logical consistency evaluation
7. **Limitations:** What this hypothesis cannot explain

## Hypothesis Categories (Future)

Once ORCID publications are ingested, hypotheses may include:
- Trajectory hypotheses (hyperbolic vs. bound, gravitational vs. non-gravitational)
- Composition hypotheses (volatile-rich vs. refractory, porous vs. compact)
- Origin hypotheses (planetary system ejection vs. stellar disruption vs. galactic)
- Acceleration hypotheses (outgassing vs. radiation pressure vs. novel mechanisms)

## Testability

All hypotheses MUST be:
- **Falsifiable:** Can be proven wrong in principle
- **Testable:** Makes specific predictions
- **Logically Consistent:** No internal contradictions
- **Framework-Explicit:** Clear which theory generates the hypothesis

## Status

⚠️ **AWAITING ORCID ID**

This layer will be populated once ORCID publications are ingested and theoretical frameworks are extracted.

## Governance

- **Exploratory:** Hypotheses are proposals, not validated conclusions
- **Non-Final:** All content is preliminary
- **ORCID-Traced:** Hypotheses traceable to ORCID sources
- **Internal-Only:** Not for publication
