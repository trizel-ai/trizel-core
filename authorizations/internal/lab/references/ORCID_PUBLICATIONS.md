**Abstract/Summary:**
This paper applies AUTO DZ ACT to the entire dataset of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Instead of proposing a physical model, the work introduces a state-based classification system to distinguish between what is testable, undecidable, or unconstrained by current data. This provides a reproducible methodology for interpreting scientific observations while avoiding premature conclusions.

**Key Contributions:**
- Introduction of AUTO DZ ACT for verification
- State-based epistemic classification system
- Testability criteria for 3I/ATLAS observations
- Methodological rigor for avoiding premature scientific conclusions
- Distinction between testable, undecidable, and unconstrained claims

**Relevance to 3I/ATLAS Laboratory:**
- **Primary Relevance:** Provides core methodological framework for this laboratory
- **Epistemic Framework:** Defines how to classify scientific claims about 3I/ATLAS
- **Verification Method:** AUTO DZ ACT serves as primary verification tool
- **Testability Guidance:** Establishes boundaries for what can be tested vs. speculated
