# Laboratory Concepts Layer

**Layer:** CONCEPTS  
**Laboratory:** LAB-3I-ATLAS-001  
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Purpose

This layer stores **fundamental theoretical concepts** extracted from ORCID-validated publications and relevant to 3I/ATLAS analysis.

## Content Structure

Each concept entry MUST include:

1. **Concept Name:** Clear identifier
2. **Definition:** Precise conceptual definition
3. **Source Traceability:** ORCID → Publication → Section/Page
4. **Relevance:** How concept applies to 3I/ATLAS
5. **Relationships:** Links to other concepts in this layer

## Examples (Future)

Once ORCID publications are ingested, this layer may include concepts such as:
- Interstellar trajectory dynamics
- Non-gravitational acceleration mechanisms
- Composition models for celestial objects
- Orbital parameter definitions
- Hyperbolic escape velocity concepts

## Status

⚠️ **AWAITING ORCID ID**

This layer will be populated once ORCID publications are ingested and processed.

## Governance

- **Hypothesis-Driven:** Concepts explored, not assumed as truth
- **Pre-Paradigmatic:** Language avoids dogmatic assertions
- **ORCID-Traced:** All concepts traceable to ORCID sources
- **Internal-Only:** Not for publication

**No content currently present. Awaiting ORCID input.**
