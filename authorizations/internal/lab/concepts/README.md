# Laboratory Concepts Layer

**Layer:** CONCEPTS  
**Laboratory:** LAB-3I-ATLAS-001  
**Authorization:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001

---

## Purpose

This layer stores **fundamental theoretical concepts** extracted from ORCID-validated publications and relevant to 3I/ATLAS analysis.

## Status

✅ **READY FOR POPULATION**

ORCID publications ingested. Key concepts identified for extraction:
- Epistemic states (testable, undecidable, unconstrained)
- Brightness anomalies
- Spectral features
- Jet-like plasma events
- Post-perihelion behavior
- Verification framework principles
- Testability criteria

## Content Structure

Each concept entry MUST include:

1. **Concept Name:** Clear identifier
2. **Definition:** Precise conceptual definition
3. **Source Traceability:** ORCID → Publication → Section/Page
4. **Relevance:** How concept applies to 3I/ATLAS
5. **Relationships:** Links to other concepts in this layer

## Source Publications

Concepts extracted from:
- [PUB001] Epistemic State Analysis (AUTO DZ ACT)
- [PUB002] Physical and Spectral Analysis

## Governance

- **Hypothesis-Driven:** Concepts explored, not assumed as truth
- **Pre-Paradigmatic:** Language avoids dogmatic assertions
- **ORCID-Traced:** All concepts traceable to ORCID sources
- **Internal-Only:** Not for publication

**Layer ready for population from ORCID-validated publications.**
