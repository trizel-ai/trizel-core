## 3. Authority

This policy is governed exclusively by **TRIZEL Core**.

No external repository, automation, or presentation layer
may override, bypass, or reinterpret this policy.

---

## 4. Core Principles

1. **Evidence-first** — No claim without traceable evidence
2. **Layer separation** — Governance never executes science
3. **Non-public by default** — Internal means internal
4. **Explicit approval** — No implicit authorization
5. **Traceability** — All decisions must be auditable

---

## 5. Automation Constraint

No automation affecting governance-critical artifacts is permitted
unless explicitly approved by Governance Authority
and documented with a revision record.
