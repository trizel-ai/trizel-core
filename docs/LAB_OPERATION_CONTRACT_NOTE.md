# LAB_OPERATION_CONTRACT — V001 (Governance Note)

This artifact is Layer-0 and non-executing. It binds Gate-5 operational readiness by defining permanent integration rules for Layer-1.

Key binding effect:
- Layer-1 cannot claim verification states unless ingress records exist and match allow-lists + time-window binding.
- Layer-2 remains presentation-only and references only the contract and resulting immutable artifacts (e.g., execution manifests, verification states), never the operation mechanics.

This note exists to support governance mapping and institutional technical review.
