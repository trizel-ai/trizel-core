# TRIZEL Governance Ledger

**Repository:** trizel-ai/trizel-core  
**Document Type:** Canonical Governance Record  
**Authority Level:** Layer-0 (Foundational)  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-18  

---

## Document Purpose

This document serves as the **epistemic and procedural ledger of the entire TRIZEL project**.

It is the **single authoritative source** for:
- Project governance identity and principles
- SYSTEM FREEZE declarations and status
- Authorized exceptions to governance rules
- Terminology governance and resolutions
- Scientific reference authority models
- Chronological governance event history
- Derivative document policies

All other governance documents, changelogs, PR records, templates, and automation derive their authority from this ledger.

**This is not a PR-specific document. This is project-wide, permanent, and foundational.**

---

## I. Project Governance Identity

### Project Name
**TRIZEL** — Technology for Research, Inference, Zonal Evaluation & Learning

### Governance Model
**Epistemic, Governance-First Architecture**

TRIZEL operates under a governance-first model where:
- Governance precedes execution
- Epistemic structure precedes scientific claims
- Procedural authority precedes content authority
- Separation of concerns is mandatory and enforced

### Authority Scope (Layer-0)
This repository (`trizel-core`) operates at **Layer-0: Governance & Charter**.

Layer-0 defines:
- Epistemic pipeline structure
- Repository classification and roles
- Canonical vs non-canonical boundaries
- Enforcement rules and compliance requirements
- Authorization frameworks and exception processes

Layer-0 does NOT:
- Execute scientific analysis
- Host datasets or models
- Perform computations
- Make scientific claims
- Publish research findings

### Non-Goals (Explicit)
TRIZEL Governance explicitly excludes:

1. **No Execution**
   - No algorithmic execution
   - No data processing
   - No model training or inference
   - No computational experiments

2. **No Public Science**
   - No publication of scientific findings
   - No DOI minting (except under explicit authorization)
   - No Zenodo deposits (except under explicit authorization)
   - No citation generation as scientific output

3. **No Interpretation**
   - No endorsement of scientific theories
   - No validation of hypotheses
   - No claims of correctness
   - No preference between competing models

**Governance provides structure. Science provides content. These roles are never mixed.**

---

## II. Global SYSTEM FREEZE Declaration

### Definition
**SYSTEM FREEZE** is a governance state in which all scientific activity across the TRIZEL ecosystem is prohibited by default unless explicitly authorized through documented exception processes.

### Declaration Status
**ACTIVE** — The SYSTEM FREEZE is currently in effect and binding across all TRIZEL repositories and activities.

### What Is Frozen

#### Layer-1 (Research Documentation)
- Research documentation may exist internally
- Research documentation is **NOT AUTHORIZED** for publication
- No public release of research findings is permitted

#### Layer-2 (Presentation)
- Presentation layer is permanently non-scientific
- Limited to documentation and presentation of governance
- No scientific content is authorized in Layer-2

#### All Scientific Activities
The following activities are **globally frozen** unless explicitly authorized:

1. **Scientific Publication** — No publication of scientific findings or research
2. **DOI Minting** — No minting of Digital Object Identifiers
3. **Zenodo Archiving** — No archiving of scientific records
4. **Citation Generation** — No generation of scientific citations as TRIZEL output
5. **Research Release** — No public release of research documentation from Layer-1
6. **Scientific Analysis** — No execution or publication of scientific analysis
7. **Dataset Publication** — No publication of scientific datasets
8. **Model Release** — No release of trained models or algorithms
9. **Scientific Claims** — No assertion of scientific findings as validated
10. **Public Scientific Communication** — No external scientific communication as TRIZEL output

### What Can Never Change Without Explicit Authorization

The following governance principles are **immutable** without Layer-0 governance decision:

1. **Epistemic Pipeline Structure** — The mandatory separation of observation, analysis, inference, interpretation, and evaluation
2. **Layer Boundaries** — The separation between governance, data, analysis, and presentation layers
3. **Canonical Authority** — The designation of `trizel-core` as Layer-0 governance authority
4. **SYSTEM FREEZE Default State** — Scientific activity remains prohibited by default
5. **Authorization Requirement** — All exceptions require explicit, documented authorization
6. **Governance-First Principle** — Governance structure precedes and constrains all scientific activity

### Authorization Pathway

Scientific activity may be authorized ONLY through:

1. Submission of formal authorization request via Scientific Authorization Framework
2. Independent scientific reviewer evaluation (minimum 2 reviewers)
3. Governance verification and compliance check
4. Explicit written authorization document issued by Layer-0
5. Recording in Section III (Authorized Exceptions Registry) of this ledger

**No other pathway exists. No implicit authorization is recognized.**

### Compliance Requirement

All Pull Requests, commits, and repository changes must comply with SYSTEM FREEZE restrictions.

Non-compliant changes must be rejected at review or CI enforcement.

---

## III. Authorized Exceptions Registry

This section maintains a **structured registry of all authorized exceptions** to the SYSTEM FREEZE.

Each exception must include:
- Authorization ID (unique identifier)
- Effective date
- Status (ACTIVE, REVOKED, EXPIRED)
- Scope (what is authorized)
- Prohibitions (what remains forbidden)
- Authorization document reference
- Revocability clause

### Current Authorizations

#### SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001 — Epistemic Analysis Frame for 3I/ATLAS

**Authorization ID:** SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Status:** ACTIVE (Limited Scope)  
**Authority:** TRIZEL Governance (Layer-0)  
**Document:** `docs/authorizations/SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001.md`

**Scope (Strictly Limited):**
- **Epistemic analysis frame development only**
- Limited to interstellar object 3I/ATLAS
- Theoretical physics analysis (non-observational)
- Mathematical and conceptual modeling
- Internal governance documentation only

**Authorized Activities:**
- Orbital dynamics analysis (analytical or simulated)
- Theoretical composition hypotheses
- Conceptual origin models
- Non-gravitational force modeling (theoretical)
- Mathematical or physical consistency analysis

**Explicit Prohibitions:**
- No observational activity
- No use of proprietary or embargoed data
- No new data acquisition
- No cosmological generalization beyond 3I/ATLAS
- No claims about stellar evolution, galactic structure, or universal mechanics
- **No publication, DOI registration, or Zenodo deposits**
- **No public scientific communication as TRIZEL output**
- No interpretation as validated physical claim

**Terminology Note:**
The authorization identifier preserves the term "THEORY" for historical continuity and technical reference (SA-3I-ATLAS-**THEORY**-001). However, the authorized activity is correctly designated as **"epistemic analysis frame"** — a methodological construct, not a physical theory.

**Revocability:**
This authorization may be revoked at any time without justification by Layer-0 governance authority. Revocation may occur automatically upon scope violation, governance decision, or issuance of a new SYSTEM FREEZE declaration.

**Relationship to SYSTEM FREEZE:**
This represents a narrow and controlled exception. The SYSTEM FREEZE remains ACTIVE for all other scientific domains. This authorization does not create precedent for other exceptions.

---

### Authorization History

| Authorization ID | Effective Date | Status | Scope Summary | Revocation Date |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001 | 2026-01-18 | ACTIVE | Epistemic analysis frame for 3I/ATLAS (internal only) | — |

---

## IV. Terminology Governance

### Purpose
This section establishes **canonical definitions** for key terminology and records **explicit resolutions** of terminology conflicts or evolution.

### Canonical Definitions

#### TRIZEL
**Technology for Research, Inference, Zonal Evaluation & Learning**

An institutional-grade scientific governance system designed to enforce strict separation between observation, analysis, inference, interpretation, and evaluation across multiple repositories under a unified epistemic framework.

#### Layer-0 (Governance & Charter)
The foundational governance layer. Defines rules, structure, and boundaries. Contains no scientific content, data, or executable code. Repository: `trizel-core`

#### SYSTEM FREEZE
A governance state prohibiting all scientific activity by default unless explicitly authorized through documented exception processes.

#### Epistemic Analysis Frame
A methodological construct for organizing theoretical reasoning about a subject. An epistemic analysis frame is **not a physical theory** but rather a structured approach to exploring hypothetical relationships, constraints, and consistency requirements.

An epistemic analysis frame:
- Organizes reasoning about a domain
- Establishes internal logical consistency
- Does NOT assert physical truth
- Does NOT claim observational validation
- Serves as an analytical tool, not a scientific claim

#### Canonical Repository
A repository with structural authority to define rules, processes, or standards. Canonical status does NOT imply correctness of scientific content. It implies **governance authority only**.

#### Non-Canonical Repository
A repository that explores interpretations, models, or speculative ideas without structural authority. May contain scientific hypotheses or exploratory work.

### Terminology Resolution: "THEORY" → "EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME"

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Authority:** TRIZEL Governance (Layer-0)  
**Status:** RESOLVED

#### Background
Initial authorization documentation used the term "THEORY" to describe the authorized scientific activity for 3I/ATLAS analysis (SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001).

#### Issue
The term "THEORY" implies a claim of physical truth or validated scientific model. This is inconsistent with:
- SYSTEM FREEZE restrictions on scientific claims
- TRIZEL governance principle of non-interpretation
- Epistemic separation between methodological frames and physical assertions

#### Resolution
**Replacement:** The term "THEORY" is replaced with **"EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME"** in all descriptive, narrative, and operational contexts.

**Rationale:**
- "Epistemic analysis frame" accurately describes the authorized activity: a structured methodological approach to reasoning about 3I/ATLAS
- This term makes clear that the work is **analytical and methodological**, not a claim of physical reality
- Consistent with TRIZEL's governance-first, non-interpretive stance

#### Identifier Preservation Rule
**Authorization identifiers preserve their original form for technical continuity.**

Example: **SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001**

The identifier remains unchanged because:
- It is a unique technical reference
- Changing it would break traceability
- It functions as a database key, not a semantic claim
- Historical records and references depend on identifier stability

**The identifier is preserved. The referenced activity is correctly termed "epistemic analysis frame."**

#### Application
- All new documentation uses "epistemic analysis frame"
- All narrative references use "epistemic analysis frame"
- Authorization identifiers remain unchanged
- No retroactive rewriting of merged historical documents

#### Precedent
This resolution establishes the principle that **identifiers are immutable technical references** while **terminology for the same concept may evolve** for accuracy and consistency.

---

### Deprecated Terminology

For a complete registry of permanently forbidden terms, see: `DEPRECATED_TERMS.md`

Key deprecated terms include:
- "STOE" (forbidden, must be removed completely)
- "V12–V22" and version labels (forbidden)
- Framework evolution labels implying theoretical lineage (forbidden)

**Enforcement:** CI-validated, build-blocking checks.

---

## V. ORCID Authority Model

### Principle
**ORCID records are the authoritative source for scientific references within the TRIZEL ecosystem.**

ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) provides:
- Persistent researcher identification
- Verified publication records
- Authoritative attribution
- Traceability to source material

### Ingestion Rules

#### ORCID as Primary Source
All scientific references ingested into TRIZEL must be sourced from:
1. **ORCID records** of identified researchers, OR
2. **Direct publication metadata** linked to ORCID-verified researchers, OR
3. **Explicitly authorized alternative sources** (see exceptions below)

#### Publication Ingestion Process
When ingesting external publications:

1. **Identify ORCID** — Locate the ORCID identifier of the author(s)
2. **Verify Publication** — Confirm the publication appears in the ORCID record
3. **Extract Metadata** — DOI, title, publication date, journal, authors
4. **Document Provenance** — Record ORCID identifier and retrieval date
5. **Create Internal Reference** — Store in appropriate `lab/references/` directory with ORCID attribution

#### Traceability Requirement
**Every scientific reference must be traceable:**

**ORCID → Publication → Internal Layer → Governance Record**

This chain must be documented:
- ORCID identifier of source researcher
- DOI or publication identifier
- Date of ingestion
- Internal reference document path
- Authorization under which reference was ingested (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001)

### Prohibition of Non-ORCID Sources (Default)

Unless explicitly authorized, the following are **NOT acceptable sources**:

- Personal websites without ORCID verification
- Preprint servers (unless ORCID-linked)
- Social media posts
- News articles or press releases
- Secondary citations without verification
- Unverified repositories
- Private communications (unless part of authorized collaboration)

### Explicit Exclusion: Interpretation Prohibition

Even when sourced from ORCID, TRIZEL governance **does NOT**:
- Endorse the scientific conclusions of ingested publications
- Validate the methodologies described
- Assert the correctness of findings
- Prefer one publication over another
- Interpret results

**ORCID references establish provenance only. TRIZEL remains interpretation-neutral.**

### Authorized Exceptions to ORCID Requirement

Exceptions to the ORCID-first rule may be granted when:

1. **Historical Publications** — Pre-ORCID publications from verified researchers
2. **Institutional Publications** — Official publications from recognized scientific institutions
3. **Collaboration Agreements** — Publications shared under formal collaboration with explicit authorization
4. **Data Repository References** — Public astronomical databases or catalogs (e.g., MPC, JPL Horizons)

**Each exception must be documented in the authorization granting access to the reference.**

### Examples

#### Compliant Reference Ingestion
```
Source: ORCID 0000-0001-2345-6789
Publication: "Orbital Dynamics of Interstellar Objects"
DOI: 10.1234/example.2024.001
Ingested: 2026-01-18
Authorization: SA-3I-ATLAS-THEORY-001
Location: authorizations/internal/lab/references/ORCID_PUBLICATIONS.md
```

#### Non-Compliant Reference (Rejected)
```
Source: Personal blog post
Author: Unnamed researcher
No ORCID, no DOI
Status: REJECTED — No ORCID verification
```

### Compliance Verification

All Pull Requests introducing scientific references must:
- [ ] Provide ORCID identifier of source researcher
- [ ] Verify publication in ORCID record
- [ ] Document DOI or publication identifier
- [ ] Record provenance chain
- [ ] Cite authorization permitting ingestion

### References

#### GE-2026-01-18-003: Terminology Resolution — "THEORY" → "EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME"

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Type:** Terminology  
**Summary:** Resolved terminology conflict: "THEORY" replaced with "EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME"

**Description:**
TRIZEL Governance resolved a terminology inconsistency in authorization documentation. The term "THEORY" was determined to imply physical claims inconsistent with SYSTEM FREEZE restrictions and TRIZEL's non-interpretive governance principle. The term has been replaced with "EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME" to accurately reflect the authorized activity: a methodological construct, not a physical theory.

**Rationale:**
- "Theory" implies validated physical model
- "Epistemic analysis frame" correctly describes methodological reasoning structure
- Consistent with governance-first, non-interpretive stance
- Avoids conflating analytical tools with scientific claims

**Identifier Preservation:**
Authorization identifiers (e.g., SA-3I-ATLAS-**THEORY**-001) remain unchanged for technical continuity and traceability. Identifiers function as immutable database keys.

**Application:**
- All new documentation uses "epistemic analysis frame"
- All narrative and operational references updated
- Authorization identifiers remain unchanged
- No retroactive rewriting of merged historical documents

**Authority:** TRIZEL Governance (Layer-0)

**Impact:**
- Clarified terminology aligns with governance principles
- Established precedent: identifiers are immutable; terminology may evolve
- Improved consistency across governance documentation

**References:**
- Section IV (Terminology Governance) of this ledger
- Resolution recorded in Section IV

**Status:** COMPLETED
