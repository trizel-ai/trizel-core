## Explicit Statements

This declaration is a governance-only document that establishes operational authorization for the Scientific Authorization Framework process.

**This declaration:**

1. **DOES NOT** lift the SYSTEM FREEZE globally or in any specific area.
2. **DOES NOT** authorize any scientific execution, experimentation, or research activity.
3. **DOES NOT** authorize any scientific publication, dissemination, or endorsement.
4. **DOES NOT** authorize any data generation, model creation, or scientific analysis.

**This declaration:**

1. **AUTHORIZES ONLY** the governance process for receiving, reviewing, and deciding upon future scientific authorization requests as defined in the Scientific Authorization Framework.
2. **AUTHORIZES ONLY** the administrative workflows necessary to evaluate potential scientific authorization requests.
3. **AUTHORIZES ONLY** the documentation and recording of authorization decisions within the governance framework.

The SYSTEM FREEZE remains fully active and binding. All scientific activities remain prohibited unless and until a separate, explicit scientific authorization is granted through the process established by this declaration.
