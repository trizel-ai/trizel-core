## 2. Scope of Authorization (Strict)

The authorization is limited to:

- Purely **theoretical physics**
- Analytical or mathematical modeling
- Conceptual interpretation
- Non-observational reasoning

**Object of study:**  
- Interstellar object **3I/ATLAS** only

## 3. Explicitly Permitted Activities

The following activities are permitted:

- Orbital dynamics (analytical or simulated)
- Theoretical composition hypotheses
- Conceptual origin models
- Non-gravitational force modeling (theoretical)
- Mathematical or physical consistency analysis

## 4. Explicit Prohibitions

This authorization **does NOT permit**:

- Any observational activity
- Use of proprietary or embargoed data
- New data acquisition
- Cosmological generalization beyond 3I/ATLAS
- Claims about stellar evolution, galactic structure, or universal mechanics
- Publication, DOI registration, Zenodo deposits
- Public scientific communication as TRIZEL output

Any activity outside the defined scope constitutes a governance violation.
