---

## Constitutional Authority

All authoritative definitions, epistemic law, and constitutional constraints are defined exclusively in:

This governance layer is **strictly subordinate** to the Constitution.

constitutional content.

---

## Final Statement

This repository exists to ensure **operational discipline without epistemic drift**.

It is an execution-bound governance layer — nothing more, nothing less.
